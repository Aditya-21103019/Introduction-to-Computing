Solution 3:

Enter first number: 123
Enter second number: 9

Quotient of 123 and 9 is 13
Remainder of 123 and 9 is 6

a)The function 'divmod' is callable- True

b)First number(123) is non-zero
  Second number(9) is non-zero
  Quotient(13) is non-zero
  Remainder(6) is non-zero

c)Adding (4,5,6) to initial tuple results in - (13, 6, 4, 5, 6)
The filtered out tuple is - (13, 6, 5, 6)

d)The converted set is  {5, 13, 6}

e)The required immutable set is  frozenset({5, 13, 6})

f)Maximum value from the set is 13
Hash value of the Maximum value is 13
